# JurisM_RuStyles

This repository aims to collect relevant versions on Juris-M csl citation styles.

Root folder should only contain style-folders, one-per-style. 
(Each style is a bibliography-citation format, required by some journal)

Each style should contain:
*  "docs" folder with a copy of official style documentation.
*  "examples" folder, which demonstrates as-designed behaviour: a docx/doc file(s), with 
   manually-formatted-text-example(s) + (same) automatically-formatted-text
*  "issues" folder, which demonstares known style issues, e.g. where style behaviour is different 
   from the official requirements (either fixable or not)
